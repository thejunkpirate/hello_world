# hello_world

Hello,
I've been learning Python slowly for a few months now, while the pandemic is destroying everyting out there.
In the meanwhile, I'm working on this skateboarding dataset article thing and the main architect of the website
utilizies GitHub and Git for updating and editing article, which makes sense, but that means I need to learn it.
So here we are.
